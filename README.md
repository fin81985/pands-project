##  Introduction

The **Iris dataset** is a classic in the field of statistics and machine learning. Introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936, it contains measurements of 150 iris flowers across three species: *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*. Each sample includes four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

This project uses Python and several data science libraries to:
- Explore the dataset
- Generate statistical summaries
- Create visualizations
- Perform linear regression
- Examine feature correlations

##  Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: ML utilities and datasets
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting library
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization

## Loading the Dataset

```python
df = pd.read_csv("iris_dataset/iris.data")
```

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and column names are renamed for clarity:
```python
df.columns = ['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width', 'species']
```

##  Summary Statistics

Descriptive statistics such as **mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation** were calculated for each feature using Pandas.  
Example output:
```
              mean   min   max    std   median
sepal_length  5.84  4.3   7.9   0.83    5.8
petal_length  3.77  1.0   6.9   1.76    4.4
```

This code calculates basic statistics for each numerical feature in the Iris dataset.

## Visualizations

### 1. **Histograms**
Histograms show the distribution of each feature using values generated from a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as the actual dataset.

### 2. **Scatter Plot: Sepal Length vs Petal Length**
Using randomly assigned class labels, a scatter plot showed patterns between two features. Different classes were color-coded to show the diffrence between the species.

### 3. **Linear Regression Line**
A regression line was fitted to the above scatter plot using `numpy.polyfit`. This helped showed the **linear relationship** between sepal length and petal length.

### 4. **Box Plots**
Box plots show the spread of petal lengths across the three classes, highlighting medians and potential outliers.

### 5. **Heatmap**
A **correlation matrix** shown with a heatmap highlights the relationships between features. For example, petal length and petal width show a strong positive correlation due to the color intense.

### 6. **Pair Plot**
A pair plot provides scatter plots for all the features colored by species. It reveals relationships useful for classification tasks.

##  Conclusion

This project was a great learning experience for someone new to programming. By working with the Iris dataset, some good hands on experience of using Python and some popular libraries used in data science. Through simple visualizations and basic statistical analysis, I was able to discover interesting patterns in the data. It really helped me understand how programming can be used to explore and make sense of real world data.
