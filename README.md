# pands-project

1. Project looking at the iris dataset.
2. You must research the data set.
3. Write documentation and code (in Python).

Write a program called analysis.py that:
1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate.

### breakdown analysis

1. Import Libraries

- Load essential Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.​

2. Inspect Variable Types

- Examine the data types of each column to understand the structure of the dataset.​

3. Data Exploration

- Display the first few rows to get an initial glimpse of the data.​

- Check the dataset's shape to determine the number of rows and columns.​

- Examine specific rows to understand individual data entries.​

- Analyze the distribution of the target variable, 'species', to see the balance among classes.​

- Compute summary statistics for numerical variables to assess central tendencies and dispersions.​

4. Generate and Save Variable Summaries

- Create descriptive statistics for each variable and save them for reference.​

5. Create Histograms for Each Variable

- Visualize the distribution of each numerical feature to identify patterns and potential anomalies.​

6. Scatter Plots of Variable Pairs by Species

- Plot pairwise relationships between numerical variables, color-coded by species, to observe potential correlations and class separations.​

7. Correlation Analysis & Heatmap

- Compute the correlation matrix to quantify relationships between numerical variables.​

- Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap to easily identify strong correlations.​

8. Box Plots for Outlier Detection

- Generate box plots for each numerical variable to detect and visualize outliers.​

9. Pair Plot Visualization

- Create pair plots to provide a comprehensive view of relationships between all pairs of variables, differentiated by species.
